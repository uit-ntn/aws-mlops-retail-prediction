We’re excited to announce that AWS Partner Central is now available in the AWS Management Console, simplifying access to Partner Central and the AWS Marketplace Management Portal. This launch introduces powerful APIs that offer process automation and integration capabilities, helping Partners connect their business systems directly to Partner Central, and streamlining how they grow and scale with Amazon Web Services (AWS).

Built on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), this enhanced experience offers enterprise-grade security features and flexible user management and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities—making it easier to give your teams access to the tools they need for running your AWS business.

## What’s new in the enhanced Partner Central experience

The new Partner Central experience is built to support teams as they scale with AWS. By unifying access and systems, teams can more quickly navigate to the tools they need to efficiently co-sell with AWS and other Partners. This enhanced experience enables you to:

### Transform operations with powerful integration and automation

Connect your existing business systems directly to Partner Central through expanded APIs, enabling seamless integration and workflow automation. Eliminate duplicate data entry between co-selling and AWS Marketplace transactions, and streamline operations across solution management, benefit applications, and funding requests. Partner Central APIs include:

- **Account and Connections APIs** for programmatic Partner registration, profile management, and multi-Partner collaboration through joint opportunities.
- **Solution APIs** for creating and managing solution listings in AWS Marketplace.
- **Benefits APIs** for centralized benefit discovery and application of benefits across Partner programs.
- **Selling and Leads APIs** now support the complete co-sell lifecycle—from lead creation and qualification to opportunity conversion—with real-time deal progression tracking.

Partners are already leveraging these APIs to streamline operations. “Leveraging the Benefits API, we’ve streamlined the application process for Marketplace Private Offer Promotion Program (MPOPP) applications,” says Adam Boyle, VP of Product & Engineering at Tackle.io. “With this integration, users can now access pre-populated data, use AI-assisted justifications, and submit applications with a single click. These API capabilities allow sellers to manage fund requests from within the systems they are already working in on a day-to-day basis.”

Access the API Reference to start building custom integrations yourself or connect with a provider who can help you implement automations for Partner Central and AWS Marketplace.

### Get personalized guidance using Amazon Q chat

The enhanced Partner Assistant, now integrated with Amazon Q, provides tailored responses to help you navigate your AWS Partner journey. Get personalized recommendations and insights based on your Partner Path, tier, solution, opportunity pipeline, and product listings. Ask questions in your preferred local language about anything from maximizing your use of AWS Partner benefits to checking the status of a customer opportunity.

### Scale operations with flexible access controls

Through AWS IAM, you can manage permissions with precision and use your existing Workforce Identity Provider for SSO. IAM gives you precise control over user access settings without traditional limitations—like being restricted to one Alliance Lead. Implement granular access controls to match your organization’s needs, such as restricting specific opportunities to designated teams.

With SSO, your team members can access Partner tools and resources with a single set of credentials. Access the AWS IAM Identity Center guide for step-by-step guidance for connecting with identity providers. Partners using Okta can leverage Okta’s AWS Identity Center integration to streamline user onboarding and enable SSO across their organization.

Partners are already experiencing these benefits. “Arctic Wolf’s onboarding to AWS Partner Central in the AWS Console was incredibly smooth using AWS Identity Center with our existing identity provider—our IT department was able to provision users in minutes,” says Sean Phillips, VP of Strategic Alliances at Arctic Wolf. “I’m excited to no longer manage individual user permissions myself, knowing our IT team has the security controls and streamlined administration they need through IAM. We’re looking forward to leveraging the new API capabilities and automated workflows to transform how we manage our AWS partnership.”

### Expand your reach with solution discovery in AWS Marketplace

In Partner Central, you can now publish multi-product, multi-vendor solutions for public discovery in AWS Marketplace. Beyond using Partner Connections to find complementary Partners for co-selling, you can now create multi-product solutions that include multiple software and service components from multiple vendors, and list them publicly in AWS Marketplace. Customers can discover your solutions in AWS Marketplace by searching for business problems (such as “data migration”) rather than specific products, making it easier for them to find the right solutions.

Looking ahead as we continue to enhance the experience for Partners, we’re investing in AI-powered capabilities to accelerate technical reviews, approval workflows, and co-selling motions—helping you improve operational efficiency and scale your business faster with AWS.

## Get started

Visit the AWS Partner Central webpage to learn more about the new experience. New Partners can get started by registering as an AWS Partner in the AWS Console.

Existing Partners need to take action to migrate to the new Partner Central experience:

- Collaborate with your IT department to link your APN account to an AWS account and plan your user onboarding strategy. To onboard users, connect with your existing company Identity Provider, use AWS IAM Identity Center, or manage permissions directly in the IAM console.
- Schedule your migration in Partner Centralridge, Cloudsoft, CloudZone, Innovative Solutions, Labra, Rackspace, Spektra Systems, Suger, Tackle.io, and WorkSpan.
