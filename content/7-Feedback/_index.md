### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is clean and comfortable, which helps me stay focused.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and consistently encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures and documentation and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. The mentor was especially helpful during key stages such as architecture design, selecting best practices, and debugging with a “find the root cause yourself” approach. This helped me learn how systems operate in practice instead of just following instructions.

**3. Relevance of the Work to My Academic Major**  
The tasks I worked on aligned well with what I learned at university while also expanding into areas I had not previously explored. This allowed me to strengthen my fundamentals and gain real-world practical skills. The workshop directly relates to fields I care about, such as Cloud, DevOps, and Security/Networking: VPC, IAM/IRSA, container security (non-root, scan-on-push), logging/monitoring, and cost management. These topics helped me connect academic knowledge with real deployment scenarios.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me plan my career path better.

I significantly improved my implementation and operations skills, including:

- Designing an end-to-end MLOps lifecycle: training pipeline + model registry + deployment
- Packaging and deploying a FastAPI inference service on EKS
- Setting up basic monitoring with CloudWatch and configuring log retention
- Optimizing costs using Spot Instances, lifecycle policies, start/stop scheduling, and teardown scripts

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other and works seriously while still keeping the environment enjoyable.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company supports internship confirmation and provides flexible working hours when needed.

### Additional Questions

- **What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
  I was most satisfied with being able to work in a comfortable environment with clear processes. I learned how to collaborate with my mentor and teammates, how to try solving problems independently before asking for help, and I developed a “do it right – do it fully – clean it up” mindset (after deploying, always verify, document, optimize, and clean up resources—otherwise you end up paying unnecessary costs).

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
  I suggest organizing more networking or exchange activities between universities so interns can learn from one another and share experiences across different schools.

- **If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
  Yes. The environment is supportive, the mentor helps interns grow through hands-on problem solving, and the work is practical (with real deliverables). However, it is best suited for interns who are self-driven and proactive in learning.
